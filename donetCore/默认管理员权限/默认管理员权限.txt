I found the simplest workaround would be to add the app.manifest file with the setting like what in net framework app

<requestedExecutionLevel level="requireAdministrator" uiAccess="false" />
then on your net core project file (.csproj in C# project) add the following:

<PropertyGroup>
  <ApplicationManifest>app.manifest</ApplicationManifest>
</PropertyGroup>
*Worked in Console and WPF netcore 3.0
